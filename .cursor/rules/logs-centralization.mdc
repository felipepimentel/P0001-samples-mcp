# Log File Centralization Rule

All `.log` files must be stored in the [`/logs`](mdc:logs) directory. Any code or process that generates log output should write logs to this centralized location. Log files should not be placed in the project root or scattered across other directories.

If you find log files outside of [`/logs`](mdc:logs), move them to this directory to maintain consistency and project cleanliness.
